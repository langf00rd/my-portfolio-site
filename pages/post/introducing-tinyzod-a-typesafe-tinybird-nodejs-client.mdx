# introducing tinyzod - a typesafe tinybird nodejs client

tinybird is undoubtedly one of the best analytics tools out there. sadly, i find its usage a bit...stressing. why is that? let me first put this out there, the tinybird api is very good. its just a pain having to look for that one single endpoint i use to send events to my datasource every single time i need it. which is why i wrote [tinyzod](https://github.com/langf00rd/tinyzod). all the endpoints i need, accessible from designated function. no more scrolling through long lists of documentation

## what is tinyzod?

it's a typesafe tinybird client package that lets you use tinybird's apis from your nodejs
app without having to call their endpoints manually everytime.

tinyzod:

- is small in size (< 53kb)
- request caching and revalidation
- tree-shakable to reduce bundle size
- requires minimal setup, and has some pretty cool features under
  the hood.

## you mentioned validation?

yes, tinyzod has built-in support for [zod](https://zod.dev). i'm working on adding support for other validation libraries like yup, etc

> tinyzod is [opensource](https://github.com/langf00rd/tinyzod). looking forward to your feedback and contributions :)

## usage

it's dead simple. initialize the tinyzod client, pass in your tinybird token, call the functions you need with the required parameters.

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { TinyZodClient, publishToDatasource, queryPipeWithDynamicParam } from 'tinyzod';

// initialize the tinyzod client
const tz = new TinyZodClient({
  showLogs: true,
  token: 'TINYBIRD-TOKEN',
  /* other config */
});

// create your schema
const schema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  value: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  message: z.string(),
});

// publish an event to a datasource
const publish_ = await publishToDatasource({
  schema,
  client: tz,
  validator: 'zod',
  datasource: 'demo__v1',
  mode: 'append',
  data: {
    /* some data */
  },
});
```
