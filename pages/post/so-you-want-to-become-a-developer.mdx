      yes, being a developer is cool and all. you know that feeling when you open up the
      terminal or your code editor in front of your friends, and you start to feel like
      elliot from mr robot. yeah, that feeling. although this might sound great, it comes
      at a cost. don't panic; hear me out
    </p>

      i code for fun. i like to sit by my computer all day, building, anything and
      everything. makes me feel unstoppable. gives my life meaning(kinda).
      <br />a fraction of developers you see and know today learned coding for fun; the joy
      it comes with. others, to find a paying job and make money, among some other valid personal
      reasons.

      but how did they become what they are now? how do they know what they know? - time,
      passion, consistency

      you can't become a developer overnight (it only happens in movies). it takes time to
      learn programming languages, frameworks, etc.; truth is, there's something new to
      learn almost every day, and for you to become successful in this field, you must be
      willing to learn as much as you can as fast as possible in order to keep up with the
      latest shiny new trends
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      trust me, if you keep up with the consistency, it will surely pay off in the future.
      if you are a newbie, focus on acquiring the knowledge. the rewards, and the benefits
      will come later.
